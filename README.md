> Above all, donâ€™t fear difficult moments. The best comes from them.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create `Array` variables and constants and know how to use them.
* Know how to create an `Array` of `Int`'s and `String`'s. 
* Create functions that take in `Array`'s as arguments. 
* Access elements of the `Array` using *subscript syntax*.
* Change elements at a specific index using *subscript syntax*. 

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
## Outline / Notes

* I've included a playground file with this repo to get it started. 
* I can see this playground file containing 10-15 questions surrounding Arrays and reinforcing topics they've learned in prior lessons. 
* I think we can start with easy wins first asking them to make an Array of ingredients (giving them the String values to include in the array), that way they are having to type what it is they just read.
* From there we can get a more complicated, asking them to create functions that take in Array's as arguments. Considering the reading before this might not go into exactly how to pass Array's into functions - we might want to show them (although they are aware of the type signature's of arrays so they MIGHT be able to figure it out, but I prefer to nudge them in the right direction for now).
* They won't know how to use for loops... YET, so don't ask any questions that would have them loop over the array. That is coming up in the following reading.
